Sites like Chegg, CourseHero, etc. may not distribute my course materials.</p>

<p>The actual implementation, which we will use and the book uses, is quite similar to the representation we discussed at the end of the previous chapter. The one difference is that we will leave one empty spot at the beginning of the array to simplify computation.</p>
